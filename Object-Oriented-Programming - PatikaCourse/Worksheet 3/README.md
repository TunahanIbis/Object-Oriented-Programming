I designed a system for managing flights and pilots:
<br>
* Airline companies operate the flights.
* Every airline has an ID.
* The airline has different types of aircraft.
* Aircraft may be operational or in a state of repair.
* Each flight has a unique ID, departure and landing airport, departure and landing times.
* Each flight has a pilot and co-pilot and they operate the aircraft.
* Airports have unique IDs and names.
* Airline companies have pilots and each pilot has a level of experience.
* An aircraft type may require a certain number of pilots.
<br>
<b>Here's the diagram depicting this system.</b>
